/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. Window Binding - when the keyword 'this' is not bound to anything.  'this' is bound to the window

* 2. Implicit Binding - when an object's method is invoked via dot OR bracket notation, 
        the 'this' keyword is bound to the object that it was called from

* 3. New (as in new Constructor) Binding - when a new Constructor is created, 
        the 'this' keyword is bound the the newly created object.

* 4. Explicit Binding - 
        call() - when an object's method is called using using call(),
            the 'this' keyword is bound to the array inside the ().
        apply() - same as call, but the second parameter (has to be an array) 
                passed in the () will be parsed out
        bind() - same as call(), but the function is returned instead of invoked
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
